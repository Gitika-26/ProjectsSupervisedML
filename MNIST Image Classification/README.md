# MNISTImageClassification
The MNIST project involved using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits to implement a digit recognition system. We applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the KNN model was trained on the training data to predict digits accurately on unseen test images, evaluating performance through accuracy metrics.
The project demonstrated how to implement a basic digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and KNN algorithm:
Dataset: MNIST dataset containing handwritten digit images (0-9).
Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for image classification.
Process: Load dataset, split into training and testing sets, train the model with KNN, predict on test data, and evaluate accuracy.
