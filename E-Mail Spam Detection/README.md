# Spam-Email-Detection-Using-SVM
Spam Email Detection Using SVM <br>
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting spam emails using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model is trained on a dataset containing email data with binary labels indicating whether an email is spam or not. The SVM classifier leverages features extracted from email contents to accurately classify them.

Features
* Data Preprocessing: Handles loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset for training. <br>
* Model Training: Implements an SVM classifier to train on the dataset. <br>
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes GridSearchCV for optimizing the SVM hyperparameters. <br>
* Model Evaluation: Includes evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. <br>
* Model Persistence: Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future use. <br>
* Prediction: Allows for predicting whether a given email is spam or not using the trained model. <br>
* Dataset - emails.csv in emails zip folder <br>
